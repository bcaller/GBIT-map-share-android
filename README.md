# GBIT-map-share-android
Share places from Google Maps to Pebble GBIT &amp; navigate by compass

This is an Android app which lets you share locations from Google Maps to your Pebble.
It starts the Pebble app Get Back In Time [@samuelmr/pebble-getbackintime](https://github.com/samuelmr/pebble-getbackintime) and points the compass to where you want to go.

Having the compass point makes it really easy to walk somewhere new. This makes entering a destination really easy. No need to lookup the lat/long.

It requires my fork [@bcaller/pebble-getbackintime:bcaller-android-maps-share](https://github.com/bcaller/pebble-getbackintime/tree/bcaller-android-maps-share) which maybe will be pulled in to Samuel's app.
